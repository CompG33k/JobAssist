# Job Application Helper (Chrome Extension)

## What it does
- You upload your resume once (PDF/DOCX/TXT).
- It extracts text locally (no server) and tries to parse name/email/phone/address + links.
- You choose common job app preferences (gender/veteran/disability/race + work auth/sponsorship).
- When you're on a job application page, click **Auto-fill current page**.

## Build
```bash
npm i
npm run build
